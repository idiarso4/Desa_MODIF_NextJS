# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the OpenSID (Sistem Informasi Desa) application from its current CodeIgniter 3.1 + Laravel components architecture to a modern Next.js-based architecture. OpenSID is a comprehensive village information system used by Indonesian villages to manage administrative processes, public services, and citizen data. The migration aims to modernize the technology stack while preserving all existing functionality and improving performance, maintainability, and user experience.

3. WHEN data is migrated THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and relationships between all entities
4. IF any feature is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear notifications and alternative workflows

### Requirement 2: Modern Frontend Architecture

3. WHEN styling is implemented THEN it SHALL use a modern CSS framework (Tailwind CSS) for consistent design
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL implement server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO
5. WHEN users interact with forms THEN they SHALL have real-time validation and improved user experience

### Requirement 3: API and Backend Modernization

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want a well-structured REST API so that the system can easily integrate with other village systems and mobile applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is restructured THEN it SHALL provide RESTful APIs for all data operations
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL follow OpenAPI 3.0 specification standards
3. WHEN authentication is implemented THEN it SHALL use JWT tokens with proper security measures
4. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL implement proper authorization and role-based access control
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and status codes

### Requirement 4: Database Migration and Optimization

**User Story:** As a village administrator, I want the system to maintain all existing data while improving query performance so that reports and data access are faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database migration occurs THEN all existing data SHALL be preserved without loss
2. WHEN the new schema is implemented THEN it SHALL optimize relationships and indexing for better performance
3. WHEN queries are executed THEN they SHALL show measurable performance improvements over the legacy system
4. WHEN data backup is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing backup procedures

### Requirement 5: User Interface Modernization

**User Story:** As a village staff member, I want an intuitive and responsive user interface so that I can efficiently perform my tasks on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI is redesigned THEN it SHALL be fully responsive and work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN users navigate the system THEN they SHALL experience improved usability and accessibility
3. WHEN forms are displayed THEN they SHALL have better validation feedback and user guidance
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL have improved formatting and export capabilities
5. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a village with growing data needs, I want the system to handle increased load efficiently so that performance remains consistent as our data grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system handles concurrent users THEN it SHALL support at least 100 simultaneous users without performance degradation
2. WHEN pages load THEN they SHALL achieve Core Web Vitals scores in the "Good" range
3. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and lazy loading
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL complete within acceptable time limits even with large datasets

### Requirement 7: Security Enhancement

**User Story:** As a village administrator handling sensitive citizen data, I want enhanced security measures so that personal information is properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL implement multi-factor authentication options
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL use HTTPS encryption for all communications
3. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted at rest
4. WHEN security events occur THEN they SHALL be logged and monitored
5. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN they SHALL implement proper timeout and session management

### Requirement 8: Development and Deployment Modernization

**User Story:** As a developer working on the system, I want modern development tools and deployment processes so that I can efficiently maintain and update the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is developed THEN it SHALL use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
2. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL use modern build tools and optimization techniques
3. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage
4. WHEN deployment occurs THEN it SHALL support containerized deployment with Docker
5. WHEN environment configuration is managed THEN it SHALL use environment-specific configuration files

### Requirement 9: Data Migration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a village using the current OpenSID system, I want seamless data migration so that no historical data or configurations are lost during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration scripts are executed THEN they SHALL successfully transfer all user accounts and permissions
2. WHEN citizen data is migrated THEN all personal records and relationships SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN administrative data is transferred THEN all village configurations and settings SHALL remain intact
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide verification reports confirming data integrity
5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL support reverting to the previous version with data intact

### Requirement 10: Indonesian Language Interface and Menu Preservation

**User Story:** As a village administrator familiar with the current OpenSID system, I want the new system to maintain the Indonesian language interface and preserve all existing menu items so that I can continue working efficiently without learning a completely new system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system is accessed THEN all interface elements SHALL be displayed in Indonesian language
2. WHEN users navigate the system THEN all existing menu items and navigation structure SHALL be preserved exactly as in the current system
